# Mapping_files
Excel power query to map files from different folders

## Description
Using power query (Excel), I'll compare excel files-names in different folders by executing some operations as:
    filter file-name by file type
    doing some modications to files-names
    merging tables containing the files-names from different folders into one general table
    creating a check-column that shows TRUE when the same file exists twice in those folders and FALSE if the file exists in only one the of folders
